# HR Analytics Using SQL and Tableau

### Overview

This project aims to analyze employee performance and satisfaction within an organization using a real-world HR dataset. Leveraging SQL queries and visualizations in Tableau, the project delves into various factors influencing employee attrition, job satisfaction, and performance ratings.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains HR-related attributes such as employee demographics, job roles, performance ratings, job satisfaction scores, and attrition labels. It provides valuable insights into employee behavior and organizational dynamics.

### Key Analyses and Visualizations
1. Employee Count and Attrition Analysis
Analyzed employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, active employees, and average age using SQL queries.
Visualized key metrics to understand the overall attrition trend within the organization.

2. Attrition by Gender
Investigated attrition rates based on gender to identify any gender-related trends in employee turnover using SQL queries.
4. Department-wise Attrition
Explored attrition rates across different departments to understand attrition patterns within each department using SQL queries.
5. Employee Age Distribution
Analyzed the distribution of employees across age groups to gain insights into the age demographics of the workforce using SQL queries.
6. Job Satisfaction Rating
Visualized job satisfaction ratings to assess the overall job satisfaction level among employees using Tableau.
7. Education Field-wise Attrition
Examined attrition rates based on education fields to identify any correlations between educational background and attrition using SQL queries.
8. Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups
Investigated attrition rates by gender for different age groups to understand how attrition varies across age and gender categories using SQL queries.

### Tableau Visualizations
The analyses were complemented by interactive visualizations created using Tableau. The Tableau dashboard provides an intuitive way to explore the data and gain deeper insights into employee performance and satisfaction dynamics.

### Conclusion
By combining SQL analysis with visualizations in Tableau, this project facilitated a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing employee attrition, job satisfaction, and performance ratings. The insights derived from the analysis can inform strategic decisions related to talent management, employee engagement, and organizational development.

### Future Enhancements
1. Incorporate predictive modeling techniques to forecast employee attrition and identify at-risk employees.
   
3. Conduct sentiment analysis of employee feedback data to gauge overall employee sentiment and satisfaction.
4. Implement real-time data monitoring and reporting dashboards for ongoing workforce analytics.
